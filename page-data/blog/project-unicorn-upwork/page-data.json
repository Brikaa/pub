It'll be a way for developers to team up and work on paid software projects together. We'll help developers find projects that match their skillset, and help them team up with other developers to work on those projects. At the moment, the only requirement to work on these paid software projects is to have shipped a project with a team on Project Unicorn. We'll expand the requirements as we find better ways to vet developers on Project Unicorn.</p>\n<p>We started Project Unicorn with a single goal in mind, to be the place where developers come to team up, grow as developers, and work on meaningful software together. By opening up the opportunity to work on paid software, we look forward to continuing to grow Project Unicorn and continuing that goal.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project Unicorn + Upwork","date":"June 11, 2019","tags":["Upwork","Freelance"],"author":{"id":"rmoran","name":"Roy Moran","bio":"Core Team Member at Project Unicorn","github":"roymoran","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/9b46a13942b7d686d6209a804f41d968/e15c1/rmoran.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9b46a13942b7d686d6209a804f41d968/3bc21/rmoran.jpg 17w,\n/static/9b46a13942b7d686d6209a804f41d968/5ee9c/rmoran.jpg 34w,\n/static/9b46a13942b7d686d6209a804f41d968/e15c1/rmoran.jpg 68w,\n/static/9b46a13942b7d686d6209a804f41d968/9039e/rmoran.jpg 102w,\n/static/9b46a13942b7d686d6209a804f41d968/a6479/rmoran.jpg 136w,\n/static/9b46a13942b7d686d6209a804f41d968/5d47c/rmoran.jpg 460w","sizes":"(max-width: 68px) 100vw, 68px"}}}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/1dc1d388f26c90553c619d045c2f52b9/fb184/hero.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1dc1d388f26c90553c619d045c2f52b9/f709c/hero.jpg 450w,\n/static/1dc1d388f26c90553c619d045c2f52b9/2b1a3/hero.jpg 900w,\n/static/1dc1d388f26c90553c619d045c2f52b9/fb184/hero.jpg 1800w,\n/static/1dc1d388f26c90553c619d045c2f52b9/b4a0b/hero.jpg 2700w,\n/static/1dc1d388f26c90553c619d045c2f52b9/2a223/hero.jpg 3600w,\n/static/1dc1d388f26c90553c619d045c2f52b9/66302/hero.jpg 4016w","sizes":"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"project-unicorn-upwork","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"contributing-part-ii-publishing-blog-posts"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contributing Part II: Publishing Blog Posts"}}}}}
